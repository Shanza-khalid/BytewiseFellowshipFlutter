# BytewiseFellowshipFlutter
This GitHub repository is about Flutter Fellowship. Flutter Fellowship is a program that provides hands-on experience to aspiring Flutter developers. It covers various topics, such as Flutter basics, state management, networking, and more. This repository contains all the assignments and exercises that I completed throughout my 3 months of Flutter Fellowship at ByteWise. ByteWise is a company that offers Flutter development services and solutions. I learned a lot from this program and I hope you find this repository useful.
