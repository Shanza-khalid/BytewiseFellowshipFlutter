This is the process which i used to install dart.

Install Dart SDK using zip file
Go to this link: https://dart.dev/tools/sdk/archive
Download stable version of dart

After downloading zip file extract dart sdk e.g c:\src\dart-sdk
Now copy path up to bin directory (C:\src\dart-sdk\bin) and paste it into user environment variables

Now go to terminal and run “dart –version” to check if dart installed successfully or not.
